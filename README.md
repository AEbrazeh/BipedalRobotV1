# 4-DoF Bipedal Robot V1

## Overview
This repository contains all the materials related to my BSc final project at the University of Tehran, titled "Design, Simulation and Control of a 4-DoF Bipedal Robot for Balancing and Walking using intelligent-PID and Reinforcement Learning-based Controller". The project aims to develop a bipedal robot capable of maintaining balance and walking using advanced control systems.

## Features
- **Intelligent Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control**: Fine-tuned PID parameters for stable balancing.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilized Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) algorithm for efficient and robust walking patterns.
- **Simulation**: Implemented in PyBullet for realistic physics and accurate modeling.
- **Python Packages**: Leveraged PyTorch for neural network implementation and NumPy for numerical computations.

## Versioning
This repository represents version 1 (v1) of the project. Future enhancements and iterations will be released as new versions.
